**1.Principle of the vulnerability:** 

This vulnerability exists in vm2 versions 3.9.15 and below due to a vulnerability in the source code converter (exception cleaning logic),  allowing attackers to bypass *handleException()* and leak unsanitized host exceptions which can be used to escape the sandbox and run arbitrary code in host context.

**2.How to use this package?**

At first we publish these npm packages, but we think these packages are malicious, just publish on npm is not suitable. So we deleted these packages and publish them here. You can use them for study Javascript sandbox, but don't use them to run the real malicious code.

In this code, we can modify the command string in the execSync function to execute system instructions or modify 'return process' to execute other JavaScript code, enabling the execution of other malicious operations.

**3.Output and security:**

This npm package is created solely for studying sandbox escape techniques. Its execution result merely echoes "write malicious code in return process" in the terminal and does not pose a threat to system security.
