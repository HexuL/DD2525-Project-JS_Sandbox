This vulnerability exists in versions of vm2 prior to 3.6.10. This vulnerability enables an attacker to trigger a `RangeError` exception from the host environment rather than the sandboxed context by reaching the stack call limit through infinite recursion. The exception object returned from this error is then utilized to reference the `mainModule` property of the host code running the script, allowing the attacker to spawn a `child_process` and execute arbitrary code.



**2.How to use this package?**

At first we publish these npm packages, but we think these packages are malicious, just publish on npm is not suitable. So we deleted these packages and publish them here. You can use them for study Javascript sandbox, but don't use them to run the real malicious code.

**3.Output and security:**

This npm package is created solely for studying sandbox escape techniques. Its execution result will just Execute the `whoami` command to display the current username and does not pose a threat to system security.
