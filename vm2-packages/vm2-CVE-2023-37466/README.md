**1.Principle of the vulnerability:** 

This vulnerability exits in vm2 belows 3.9.19, because vm2 is not update now, so this vulnerability exits any version of vm2. Ans this vulnerability involves the handling of Promises, how the Promise constructor can be bypassed by overriding it with a custom *Symbol.species* property. This allows attackers to insert a malicious constructor that gets invoked when a Promise attempts to resolve or reject, enabling arbitrary code execution.

**2.How to use this package?**

At first we publish these npm packages, but we think these packages are malicious, just publish on npm is not suitable. So we deleted these packages and publish them here. You can use them for study Javascript sandbox, but don't use them to run the real malicious code.

In this code, you can replace the JavaScript string within the `err.constructor.constructor` invocation with other JavaScript code , enabling the execution of other malicious operations tailored.

**3.Output and security:**

This npm package is created solely for studying sandbox escape techniques. Its execution result merely echoes "write malicious code in return process" in the terminal and does not pose a threat to system security.
